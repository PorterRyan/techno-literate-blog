Welcome to my website! I've been interested in technology for as long as I can remember; my uncle helped me and my brother build our first PC when I was seven years old. Ever since, I've been avidly curious about computers, electronics, and the communication systems that enable our modern hyper-connected society to exist. That curiousity is what led me to create this website, served to you via Microsoft Azure.
